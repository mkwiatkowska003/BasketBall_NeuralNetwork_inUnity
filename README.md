# Basket Ball _ Neural Network in Unity3D

The main goal of the project was to create a neural network algorithm in <b> C# </b> that could be used for throwing balls to basket with the highest precision.
Code files for neural network has been written regardless of the requirements of the <b> Unity </b> - the engine has been used only for simple simulation, testing and verification.
