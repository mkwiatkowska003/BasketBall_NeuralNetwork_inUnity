# Introduction 
The main goal of the project was to create a neural network algorithm in C# that could be used for throwing balls to basket with the highest precision. The project has been done using Unity3D engine, but the neural network algorithm has been written regardless of requirements of the platform - the engine was used only for a simple results simulation, testing and verification.  

# Getting Started
To run the application, open the project from Unity environment and provide the location of the folder downloaded from this site (go to File->Open Project, and then specify a Unity project's folder). After successful opening, in Unity environment go to the Assets/Scene and choose the "SampleScene.Unity". Finally, the following scene should appear on your screen.
